# RIPE Internet Dataset Descriptions

This repository contains descriptions of some of the RIPE NCC datasets. The
goal of this repository is to document the artefacts present in the datasets
that are relevant for (academic) researchers that consume these datasets.

*Contributions are welcome!*

| Dataset                                         | Description                                                                            |

| [RIPE RIS dumps](ris-mrt-files.md)              | The RIPE RIS archive of routing data in MRT format, starting from 1999.                |
| [RPKI repository archive](rpki-repo-archive.md) | An archive of Resource Public Key Infrastructure  repository content starting in 2011. |

This is meant to be a collaborative source of information surrounding these
datasets and not primary documentation. Furthermore the RIPE NCC publishes other
data (for example on RIPE Atlas) that is not (yet) described here.
